once upon a time......

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. 
They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. 
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. 
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. 
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. 
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion, there was no finer boy anywhere.

At the zoo on Dudley’s birthday, the glass in front of a boa constrictor exhibit disappears, frightening everyone. Harry is later punished for this incident.


 Mysterious letters begin arriving for Harry. They worry Mr. Dursley, who tries to keep them from Harry, but the letters keep arriving through every crack in the house. Finally, he flees with his family to a secluded island shack on the eve of Harry’s eleventh birthday. At midnight, they hear a large bang on the door and Hagrid enters. Hagrid hands Harry an admissions letter to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that the Dursleys have tried to deny Harry’s wizardry all these years




The next day, Hagrid takes Harry to London to shop for school supplies. First they go to the wizard bank, Gringotts, where Harry learns that his parents have left him a hefty supply of money. They shop on the wizards’ commercial street known as Diagon Alley, where Harry is fitted for his school uniform. Harry buys books, ingredients for potions, and, finally, a magic wand—the companion wand to the evil Voldemort’s.







 they all lived happily ever after......
